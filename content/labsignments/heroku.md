# Description

This lab contains three phases. In Phase one, you will build a simple Django website. Understand the fundamentals of Django's MVC architecture using the built-in models and views.

In Phase two, you will deploy the Django application to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). Understand the reasoning behind Platform as a Service (PaaS) businesses like Heroku. You may follow the official documentation.

In Phase three, you will apply the lab material to add a new API route and a comment section to your polls application!

## Learning Goals

* Using esbuild to bundle and create static files with NPM packages for Django to server using whitenoise from Heroku.
* Django config (Level 2)
* Django routes (Level 2)
* Django models (Level 2)
* Using Django with Postgres backend on Heroku
* Using Django with Sqlite backend for local testing

### Good Comments

Good comments describe 'what' the code is doing only if that isn't clear from the way the code is written. However, focus is on 'why' something is being done. 

A good comment for a conditional statement should make it clear why the statement was required. Potentially even giving insight into what would happen if it wasn't there. 
```python

'''
More than one item should exist for clustering to take place. So if we only have one DataEntry in
a timeline/trace, then it just goes in its own cluster and we skip the clustering process. 
'''
if(len(all_embeddings) > 1):
    <clustering logic>
else:
    <skip clustering>
```

A good comment for a function call describes why the function is invoked. In dynamically typed languages like python it can also be helpful to describe what to expect from the result of a function call/operation. 

```python
'''
all_embeddings will contain an n by m vector where n is the number of dimensions for the embeddings, and m is the number of embeddings (or timeline entities of this symbol). 

So each 'row' in this variable is an embedding of a timeline entity for this symbol.

This is the format expected by do_h_clustering(). 
'''
all_embeddings = np.vstack(_embeddings)
```

A good comment for a loop provides context into why the loop logic is required. If you are iterating over a collection of things, describe the purpose of the operations beind applied. If you are manipulating the objects in the list, why are those manipulations required?

```python
'''
All of a premium user's likes are converted into super likes before the like view is displayed.
The html template will highlight elements in super_likes. While elements in user_likes are treated normally.
'''
for like_object in user_likes: 
    super_likes.append(SuperLike(like_object))    
```

In general, a good comment explains why the code is needed, when it runs, how it relates to other code, and exceptional situations that we need to make sure work correctly.

```py
    def read_row(self, row): # this is called once for every row in the menti export
        # Usually each student has their own row, but if they reconnect they might have several
        name = self.find_name(row) 
        if name is None: # returned when find_name can't find any codenames in the row
            return 
        self.add_name(name) # set up some data structures before we process the questions and answers
        responded = {question: None for question, _ in self.question_response_count.items()} # we need a new dictionary for every student (row), but we'll fill in the values later
```

### Bad Comments

Bad comments describe the code, providing no/little further insight beyond what one might get from simply reading the code. 

A bad comment for a conditional statement describes the condition being tested.

```python
# If the length of the all embeddings variable is bigger than 1
if(len(all_embeddings) > 1):
    <clustering logic>
else:
    <skip clustering>

```

A bad comment for a loop provides describes the loop logic. If you are iterating over a collection of things, it describes that you are iterating over a collection. If you are manipulating the objects in the collection, it says that the objects are being manipulated.

```python
# Iterate throught all like objects in user_likes. 
for like_object in user_likes: 
    # Create a super like and append it to super_likes
    super_likes.append(SuperLike(like_object))    
```


A bad comment for a function call describes that a function is being called, specifying the name of the function being called and the variable in which the result is stored.

```python
# Apply the vstack function from numpy  (https://numpy.org/) to the _embeddings and store the result in all_embeddings.
all_embeddings = np.vstack(_embeddings)
```

In general, a bad comment doesn't tell someone who knows the programming language anything they didn't already know. If you need to explain what a variable is for it's usually better to fix the variable name to be descriptive, rather than adding a comment.

```py
    def read_row(self, row): # reads the row
        name = self.find_name(row) # find the name
        if name is None: # if there's no name
            return # give up
        self.add_name(name) # add the name
        responded = {question: None for question, _ in self.question_response_count.items()} # make a dictionary of the questions
```

### Avoiding the University Firewall

<!-- They aren't walking us through this lab bc of holidays. -->

This *might* affect your Heroku domain. The University's firewall is also inconsistent so it doesn't *always* seem to do this.
IST is looking into it, but, I don't know how long that will take. IST claims that this firewall
triggers after "a proprietary amount of activity." So, please expect that **your Heroku could become blocked by UWS at any time.** We will **not** give you an extension if your Heroku is blocked.

<!-- Double check that your Heroku is not blocked before your walkthrough. --> 

You have several options to make sure this doesn't happen:

* Bypass the University's DNS server by adding the hostname and IP address of your Heroku site to your hosts file.
    * Follow the steps of the "Checking your Heroku app" below.
    * Then add it your hosts file:
        * It uses the format `ip-address host-name host-name` on each line.
            * Example (has CNAME): `46.137.15.86 ie02.ingress.herokuapp.com example-app-1234567890ab.herokuapp.com`
            * Example (no CNAME): `34.201.81.34 lab3test-fbb81150e720.herokuapp.com`
        * Linux: edit /etc/hosts as superuser.
        * macOS: <https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/edit-mac-hosts-file/>
        * Windows 10/11: <https://allthings.how/how-to-edit-hosts-file-in-windows-11/>
    * If it stops working check again with nslookup and update it.
* New: use CIRA Canadian Shield as your DNS server: <https://www.cira.ca/en/canadian-shield/>
* Use a VPN service or proxy.
* Walkthrough us your lab over using another internet not provided by the University while in the lab.
* Windows: [enable DoH](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/dns/doh-client-support).
* Firefox: [enable DoH](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-dns-over-https).
* Chrome: [enable DoH](https://simpledns.plus/kb/195-how-to-enable-dns-over-https-doh-in-chrome)
    * Edge: Should be similar to chrome.
    * Other chrome-based browsers: should be similar to chrome.

# Getting Started

## Get an Environment with a Recent Python Version

[Make sure you have a working development environment with these instructions!]({filename}/general/environment.md)

## Prepare your Repo

1. Get the GitHub classroom link from eClass, create your assignment, and clone it.
2. Create an appropriate `.gitignore` file, to prevent unwanted files being commited to your repository.

Place this gitignore within the root of your project. You can combine [this one](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore) and [this one](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Node.gitignore) and [this one](https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/.gitignore) for your django+node project. Double check you're not staging any unwanted files before you commit. The `git status` command can help with that.

Make sure your `.gitignore` contains `*.sqlite3`.

## Create the Virtual Environment

Virtual environment is a CLI tool for managing python dependencies. Different projects have different dependencies, and version requirements. A virtual environment allows you to manage your dependencies specific to your project.

### If you have multiple versions of python installed:

Always end the python command with the version number. 

For example, on the undergrad machines ugXX.cs.ualberta.ca: you can use `python3.11`.

### Check if you have pip

`python3.XX -m pip` should give information about how to use pip.

For example, on the undergrad machines ugXX.cs.ualberta.ca: you can use `python3.11 -m pip`.

### Check if you have venv or virtualenv

`python3.XX -m venv --help` should give information about how to use venv.

If you don't have `venv`, try `virtualenv`: `python -m virtualenv --help` should give information about how to use virtualenv.

For example, on the undergrad machines ugXX.cs.ualberta.ca: you can use `python3.11 -m venv --help`.

### If you don't have venv or virtualenv:

1. Run `python3.XX -m pip install --user virtualenv`
2. Check installation: `python -m virtualenv --help` 

For more info check [here](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html).

### Create a Virtual Environment

1. `python3.XX -m virtualenv venv` (or `python3.XX -m venv venv`)
2. `source venv/bin/activate` (or `cd venv/scripts && activate.bat` if you're on Windows)

The first command will create a directory named `venv`. Contained in the directory is your project dependency installations and the `activate` script to enter the virtual environment. When you want to exit the environment, run `deactivate`.

# Lab Instructions

## Phase One: Django Polls App

**For phase one of this lab,** you will be creating a polls application that allows end users to be able to create and be able to answer multiple choice polls.

### Creating a Django Project

* Based on Official Docs [Overview](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/intro/overview/), [Installation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/intro/install/)

Make sure to use a **virtual environment** for this lab and that it is activated as shown above!

```
echo "Django>=5.1.1" > requirements.txt
python3.11 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**If you are encountering an issue with this command in regards to a library called `html5lib` you will need to update your pip version first.**
```
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -O ./get-pip.py
python3.11 ./get-pip.py
```

If you're doing this on **Windows** please make sure to follow the Windows
instructions for Lab 1 before starting this lab!

You can tell Django is installed and which version by running the following command in a shell prompt:

```bash
python -m django --version
```

Initialize a new Django project in your repo.

<aside markdown="block" class="option1">
Recommended option: Django project in root of repo.

```bash
# We are creating a project named "lab3" in the relative directory "." (our current directory)
django-admin startproject lab3 .

# The manage.py file is a script included in all Django projects that lets you run various tasks (e.g. starting the server)
python manage.py runserver
```

Your repo should look like this:

```text
.
├── lab3
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── asgi.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py
└── manage.py
```
</aside>

<aside markdown="block" class="option2">
Alternate option: Django project in folder.

If you do `django-admin startproject lab3` (with no `.`) before that's fine, but your django project will be in folder in your git repo, so you will
need to use the noted alternate instructions. Your repo would look like this, with a `lab3` folder inside of a `lab3` folder.

You will need to be inside the `lab3` folder to run manage.py.

```text
.
└── lab3
    ├── lab3
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── asgi.py
    │   ├── settings.py
    │   ├── urls.py
    │   └── wsgi.py
    └── manage.py
```
</aside>

Now that the server’s running, visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) with your web browser. You’ll see a “Congratulations!” page, with a rocket taking off. It worked!

----

### Creating a Django App

 * Based on Official Docs [Part 1](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial01/) (Naming may vary)

Create a new application within your django project called **polls**.

```bash
python manage.py startapp polls
```

Create a file at *polls/urls.py* with the following code. This will handle incoming traffic to the `polls/` route that we will be creating in this phase of this lab.

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

# urlpatterns contains all of the routes that this application supports routing for.
# this routes traffic from polls/ to the index function that we defined earlier in the views file.
urlpatterns = [
    path("", views.index, name="index"),
]
```

We will need also need to add a index view for our polls application when it receives traffic at `polls/`. Modify the *polls/views.py* file to look like the following.

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

# Later on, the index function will be used to handle incoming requests to polls/ and it will return the hello world string shown below.
def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world. You're at the polls index.")
```

Within `lab3/urls.py`, we need to modify it to route traffic to our newly added `polls/views.py`. replace it with the following code.

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

# this urlpatterns is different from the polls urlpatterns because lab3 is a project rather than an app. 
# This urls.py is the base and forwards requests to the urls.py of the applications
urlpatterns = [
    path("polls/", include("polls.urls")),  # All requests sent to polls/ should be handled by polls/urls.py
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),    # Django has a built in admin panel we will use later
]
```

Run the Django project with the runserver command.

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Go to [http://localhost:8000/polls/](http://localhost:8000/polls/) in your browser, and you should see the text “Hello, world. You’re at the polls index.”, which you defined in the index view.

If you get an error page here, check that you’re going to [http://localhost:8000/polls/](http://localhost:8000/polls/) and not [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).


----

### Working with Models

* Based on Official Docs [Part 2](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial02/)

Time to create our first models for our polls application. Open up *settings.py* and ensure that the default database is set to `sqlite3`.

It should look like this:
```python
# Database
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/settings/#databases

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
    }
}
```

Within *polls/models.py* include the following code. Django's ORM allows you to define the properties you want stored in the database for a specific object (you can think of this as like an SQL table!) and provides you the ability to store, retrieve, and delete data from your Django database without having to write the database-specific code yourself. The attributes defined in each class represent the data fields that the model should store in the database.

```python
from datetime import datetime
from django.db import models

class MultipleChoiceQuestion(models.Model):
    question_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)    # Store the question in a char field in the database
    pub_date = models.DateTimeField("date published", default=datetime.now)   # Store the published date in a datetime field in the database

class MultipleChoiceOption(models.Model):
    question = models.ForeignKey(MultipleChoiceQuestion, on_delete=models.CASCADE)  # All multiple choice options belong to a multiple choice question
    choice_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)  # Store the text for this option in the database
    votes = models.IntegerField(default=0)          # Store the amount of votes this choice has received
```

With this, we are creating both a `MultipleChoiceQuestion` and `MultipleChoiceOption` model. Multiple Choice Questions have options to choose from. Because this is a RDBMS, each `MultipleChoiceOption` links to a specific `MultipleChoiceQuestion` instance. Which is why we use `models.ForeignKey` to specify a foreign reference to the `MultipleChoiceQuestion` model. For more information, you can check out the official documentation [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/db/examples/many_to_one/).

**Note**: If you're having problems with your comments not rendering, make sure your foreign key does not have a `related_name` property as this will break the template.

To activate our poll application in our project, we need to add it to the installed apps within `lab3/settings.py`. 

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "polls",   # Include this line in your INSTALLED_APPS variable!
    "django.contrib.admin",
    "django.contrib.auth",
    "django.contrib.contenttypes",
    "django.contrib.sessions",
    "django.contrib.messages",
    "django.contrib.staticfiles",
]
```

Make the database migrations.

```bash
# Database migrations are responsible for applying your model definitions to the actual database! It's important to note that this does not modify your database yet.
python manage.py makemigrations polls
```

You should see something similar to the following:

```bash
Migrations for 'polls':
  polls/migrations/0001_initial.py
    - Create model Question
    - Create model Choice
```

Run the migration command to create the tables in your database.

```bash
# This command takes the migrations we created earlier to modify the database, and applies them to the actual database.
python manage.py migrate
```

Each Django project starts out using the default SQLite3 database provider, and that data is stored in the `db.sqlite3` file. Make sure your `.gitignore` contains `*.sqlite3`, and that you commit your change so that your `db.sqlite3` does not get pushed to your github repo.

### Using Django Admin

Django comes with a builtin admin dashboard that allows us to see and modify the model data that we have created. However, we need credentials in order to login to the admin dashboard. Run this command and to create a admin user that can log into the admin site. 

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

You will be asked to enter your username, email, and password (twice for confirmation).

Make the polls app modifiable in the admin by editing the *polls/admin.py* file to be the following:

```python
from django.contrib import admin

from .models import MultipleChoiceOption, MultipleChoiceQuestion

# These lines register your models with the django admin panel. If you do not include these lines, the data associated with these models will not be visible in your admin panel!
admin.site.register(MultipleChoiceQuestion)
admin.site.register(MultipleChoiceOption)
```

Start the development server again and go to `/admin` on your local domain – e.g., [http://localhost:8000/admin/](http://localhost:8000/admin/). You should see the admin’s login screen and can login with your admin account.

```bash
python manage.py runserver
# navigate to /admin
```

After logging in, you should see both a `MultipleChoiceQuestion` and `MultipleChoiceOption` link.

#### TASK - Create Example Multiple Choice Questions

The admin panel lets us view our model data in a visual way, however we havent't created any new data! In the admin panel, click "+ Add" next to "Multiple choice questions" and create an example multiple choice question. Similarly, do the same process for "Multiple choice options", except to create options for the "Multiple choice options". 

**Your task** is to create some example `MultipleChoiceQuestion` and `MultipleChoiceOption` objects in the admin panel. This will be important later on as we create our poll application!

### Working with Views

* Based on Official Docs [Part 3](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial03/)

Now that we have some multiple choice questions in the database, let's implement some logic to actually see and answer our polls! Add some additional views to the *polls/views.py* file. Include the following functions:

```python
# You'll notice that these functions include a question_id parameter in addition to the request parameter. The question_id parameter is user provided and is parsed from the url by the urlpatterns route in the next code snippet. 

def detail(request, question_id):   # http://localhost:8000/wiki/polls/5/
    return HttpResponse("You're looking at question %s." % question_id)

def results(request, question_id):  # http://localhost:8000/wiki/polls/5/results/
    response = "You're looking at the results of question %s."
    return HttpResponse(response % question_id)

def vote(request, question_id):     # http://localhost:8000/wiki/polls/5/vote/
    return HttpResponse("You're voting on question %s." % question_id)
```

With the above views added, add them to *polls/urls.py*.

```python
from django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    # ex: http://localhost:8000/polls/
    path("", views.index, name="index"),
    # ex: http://localhost:8000/polls/5/
    path("<int:question_id>/", views.detail, name="detail"),
    # ex: http://localhost:8000/polls/5/results/
    path("<int:question_id>/results/", views.results, name="results"),
    # ex: http://localhost:8000/polls/5/vote/
    path("<int:question_id>/vote/", views.vote, name="vote"),
]
```

Take a look in your browser, at `http://localhost:8000/polls/34/`. It’ll run the detail() function and display whatever ID you provide in the URL. Try `http://localhost:8000/polls/34/results/` and `http://localhost:8000/polls/34/vote/` too – these will display the placeholder results and voting pages.

----

### Making Views Render Model Data

Update the *polls/views.py* `index` method so the questions are returned.

```python
# Change the imports to this!
from django.http import HttpResponse
from .models import MultipleChoiceQuestion

def index(request):
    latest_question_list = MultipleChoiceQuestion.objects.order_by("-pub_date")[:5]
    output = ", ".join([q.question_text for q in latest_question_list])
    return HttpResponse(output)

# Leave the rest of the views (detail, results, vote) unchanged
```

Create an empty directory named *templates* within *polls*. Then create another directory named *polls* within the *templates* directory. Lastly create a file called *index.html* within the second *polls* directory.

```bash
mkdir -p polls/templates/polls
touch polls/templates/polls/index.html
```

Within the newly created empty *polls/templates/polls/index.html* file, write the following. This HTML template will iterate through every single question in the `latest_question_list` variable we created above, and render an HTML list element with a link to view the question!

```html
{% if latest_question_list %}
    <ul>
    {% for question in latest_question_list %}
        <li><a href="/polls/{{ question.id }}/">{{ question.question_text }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
{% else %}
    <p>No polls are available.</p>
{% endif %}
```

Update the `index` view in *polls/views.py* to use the new template.

```python
# Change the imports to this!
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import MultipleChoiceQuestion

def index(request):
    latest_question_list = MultipleChoiceQuestion.objects.order_by("-pub_date")[:5]
    context = {"latest_question_list": latest_question_list}
    return render(request, "polls/index.html", context)

# Do not modify the rest of the views
```

If you goto `http://localhost:8000/polls/` you should be able to see a list of the questions that you had created in earlier in the lab in the admin panel!


Add a new template file for the poll details view.

```bash
touch polls/templates/polls/detail.html
```

For the newly created template in *polls/templates/polls/detail.html*, update the content with the HTML code for our question:

```html
<h1>{{ question.question_text }}</h1>   <!-- Display the question's text -->
<ul>
{% for choice in question.multiplechoiceoption_set.all %}
    <li>{{ choice.choice_text }}</li>   <!-- Display each option's text -->
{% endfor %}
</ul>
```

Update the `detail` view in *polls/views.py* to use the new template.

```python
# Change the imports to this!
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.shortcuts import render, get_object_or_404
from .models import MultipleChoiceQuestion

# ...

def detail(request, question_id):
    question = get_object_or_404(MultipleChoiceQuestion, pk=question_id)
    return render(request, "polls/detail.html", {"question": question})
```

Remove the hardcoded urls that we specified in the *polls/templates/polls/index.html* file and replace it with a template tag referencing our url.

```html
<!-- old -->
<li><a href="/polls/{{ question.id }}/">{{ question.question_text }}</a></li>

<!-- new -->
<li><a href="{% url 'detail' question.id %}">{{ question.question_text }}</a></li>
```

----

### Namespacing URL Names

As a general good practice, you should always namespace your urls so that it is easier to reference specific paths in the case of a conflict between two apps. e.g. imagine if I also had path named `index` in another app called `poll2`. For functions that depend on the name of a specific path being passed. (E.g. when redirecting to a specific path `redirect("index")`) having that namespace allows for the two apps to share the same view name, but still allow functions that depend on specific paths to resolve to their correct app implementation. (e.g. for redirecting, I could specify `redirect("polls:index")` or `redirect("polls2:index")` depending on which app's index path I want to redirect to)


Add an `app_name` in the *polls/urls.py* file to set the application namespace.

```python
from django.urls import path

from . import views

app_name = "polls"  # Add me!
urlpatterns = [
    path("", views.index, name="index"),
    path("<int:question_id>/", views.detail, name="detail"),
    path("<int:question_id>/results/", views.results, name="results"),
    path("<int:question_id>/vote/", views.vote, name="vote"),
]
```

Change your *polls/index.html* template to point at the namespaced detail view.

```html
<!-- old -->
<li><a href="{% url 'detail' question.id %}">{{ question.question_text }}</a></li>

<!-- new -->
<li><a href="{% url 'polls:detail' question.id %}">{{ question.question_text }}</a></li>
```

----

### Writing a Simple Form

* Based on Official Docs [Part 4](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial04/)

While it's great that we can now see a list of all questions we've created, we still don't have a way of actually submitting one of our questions! Update the *polls/templates/polls/detail.html* file to match the following:

```html
<form action="{% url 'polls:vote' question.id %}" method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    <fieldset>
        <legend><h1>{{ question.question_text }}</h1></legend>
        {% if error_message %}<p><strong>{{ error_message }}</strong></p>{% endif %}
        {% for choice in question.multiplechoiceoption_set.all %}
            <input type="radio" name="choice" id="choice{{ forloop.counter }}" value="{{ choice.id }}">
            <label for="choice{{ forloop.counter }}">{{ choice.choice_text }}</label><br>
        {% endfor %}
    </fieldset>
    <input type="submit" value="Vote">
</form>
```

Remember, earlier we created a url for the polls application in *polls/urls.py* that includes this line:

```python
path('<int:question_id>/vote/', views.vote, name='vote'),
```

We also created a dummy implementation of the `vote()` function in *polls/views.py*. Let’s update the `vote` view in *polls/views.py* to handle the new template and allow us to vote on our questions.

```python
# Change the imports to this!
from django.http import HttpResponse, HttpResponseRedirect
from django.shortcuts import render, get_object_or_404
from django.urls import reverse
from .models import MultipleChoiceQuestion, MultipleChoiceOption

# ...
def vote(request, question_id):
    question = get_object_or_404(MultipleChoiceQuestion, pk=question_id)
    try:
        selected_choice = question.multiplechoiceoption_set.get(pk=request.POST["choice"])
    except (KeyError, MultipleChoiceOption.DoesNotExist):
        # Redisplay the question voting form.
        return render(
            request,
            "polls/detail.html",
            {
                "question": question,
                "error_message": "You didn't select a choice.",
            },
        )
    else:
        selected_choice.votes += 1
        selected_choice.save()
        # Always return an HttpResponseRedirect after successfully dealing
        # with POST data. This prevents data from being posted twice if a
        # user hits the Back button.
        return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse("polls:results", args=(question.id,)))
```

After voting, the application should redirect to a view displaying the results. Update the `results` view in *polls/views.py*

```python
def results(request, question_id):
    question = get_object_or_404(MultipleChoiceQuestion, pk=question_id)
    return render(request, "polls/results.html", {"question": question})
```

Create a template for the results in *polls/templates/polls/results.html*

```html
<h1>{{ question.question_text }}</h1>

<ul>
{% for choice in question.multiplechoiceoption_set.all %}
    <li>{{ choice.choice_text }} -- {{ choice.votes }} vote{{ choice.votes|pluralize }}</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<a href="{% url 'polls:detail' question.id %}">Vote again?</a>
```

Run your application. Use the admin interface to create aquestion, then create multiple choices for your question. Navigate back to `polls/` and attempt to use your application.

### Refactoring: Generic Views

To convert the `poll` application to use generic views rather than function views, we will:

1. Convert the old url conf.
2. Delete some of the old, unnecessary views.
3. Introduce new views based on Django's generic views.

Amend the *polls/urls.py* url configuration. Note that the name of the matched pattern in the path strings of the second and third patterns has changed from `<question_id>` to `<pk>`.

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

app_name = "polls"
urlpatterns = [
    path("", views.IndexView.as_view(), name="index"),
    path("<int:pk>/", views.DetailView.as_view(), name="detail"),
    path("<int:pk>/results/", views.ResultsView.as_view(), name="results"),
    path("<int:question_id>/vote/", views.vote, name="vote"),
]
```

Amend the *polls/views.py* file.

```python
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect
from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404, render
from django.urls import reverse
from django.views import generic
from .models import MultipleChoiceQuestion, MultipleChoiceOption

class IndexView(generic.ListView):
    template_name = "polls/index.html"
    context_object_name = "latest_question_list"

    def get_queryset(self):
        """Return the last five published questions."""
        return MultipleChoiceQuestion.objects.order_by("-pub_date")[:5]

class DetailView(generic.DetailView):
    model = MultipleChoiceQuestion
    context_object_name = "question"
    template_name = "polls/detail.html"

class ResultsView(generic.DetailView):
    model = MultipleChoiceQuestion
    context_object_name = "question"
    template_name = "polls/results.html"

def vote(request, question_id):
    ...  # same as above, no changes needed.
```

----

### Serializing and Deserializing Queries

Based from the DRF (Django Rest Framework) tutorial [here](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/1-serialization/)

To convert your queries to or from a JSON object you can use Django's serializers to serialize or deserialize Django QuerySets to or from JSON objects.  

First install the Django Rest Framework library using `pip` and make sure to update our `requirements.txt` file

```bash
pip install djangorestframework
pip freeze >| requirements.txt
```

Then add the `rest_framework` app to the **BOTTOM** of our `INSTALLED_APPS` in our `settings.py` file

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'rest_framework'
]
```

### Creating a Serializer Class

Create a file in the `polls` directory named `serializers.py` and add the following

```python
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import MultipleChoiceQuestion

class QuestionSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = MultipleChoiceQuestion
        fields = ['id', 'question_text', 'pub_date']
```

This automatically maps the fields from our model, and creates default create() and update() methods for us.

### Update our views using our Serializer

Once you have the serializers you now need to write some API views using the new Serializer class

Edit the `polls/views.py` file, and add the following

```python
# ADD these three imports!
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view
from rest_framework.response import Response
from .models import MultipleChoiceQuestion
from .serializers import QuestionSerializer

# ...

# We are adding a new API route that lists question data in JSON format!
@api_view(['GET'])
def get_questions(request):
    """
    Get the list of questions on our website
    """
    questions = MultipleChoiceQuestion.objects.all()
    serializer = QuestionSerializer(questions, many=True)   # many=True specifies that the input is not just a single question
    return Response(serializer.data)
```

The `@api_view` decorator will wrap the view so that only HTTP methods that are listed in the decorator will get executed.

### Updating the our URLs for the new views

Because we want our API responses to have JSON objects we will have to add another set of urls with a `api/` prefix to our `polls/urls.py` file.

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    # ...
    path('api/questions/', views.get_questions, name='get_questions'),
]
```

Now run the project again with the `runserver` command and go to `polls/api/questions/`

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

You should see a list of question in a json format.

### Updating a Question Using our Serializer

We can use the serializer to update the `question_text` field of our question entries. Add another function to `polls/views.py`

```python
@api_view(['POST'])
def update_question(request, pk):
    """
    Update a specific question
    """
    question = MultipleChoiceQuestion.objects.get(id=pk)
    serializer = QuestionSerializer(question, data=request.data, partial=True)  # partial=True means that not all required serializer properties are needed/given to the serializer.
    if serializer.is_valid():
        serializer.save()
        return Response(serializer.data)
    return Response(status=400, data=serializer.errors)
```

and update the `polls/urls.py` file.

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    # ...
    path('api/question/<int:pk>', views.update_question, name='update_question'),
]
```

Run the project using `runserver` and go to this link `polls/api/question/1` and POST the following information below.  

```json
{
    "question_text": "Updated question text"
}
```

After clicking the POST button you should see the updated value in the json structure above. The new value should also be reflected in the model admin page as well.

### Other cool things to know

Use `ModelSerializer` first:
If your serializer is just mirroring fields from a Django model, ModelSerializer saves you time. It will:
  - Automatically generate the fields from the model.
  - Provide default implementations for .create() and .update().

Use `Serializer` when you need more control:
For example, if your data doesn’t map directly to a model, or if you want to customize validation/representation. You can implement .create() and .update() yourself.
```python
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import MultipleChoiceQuestion

class QuestionSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
    id = serializers.IntegerField(read_only=True)
    question_text = serializers.CharField()
    pub_date = serializers.DateTimeField()
    is_recent = serializers.SerializerMethodField()

    # custom create logic
    def create(self, validated_data):
        return MultipleChoiceQuestion.objects.create(**validated_data)

    # custom update logic
    def update(self, instance, validated_data):
        instance.question_text = validated_data.get("question_text", instance.question_text)
        instance.pub_date = validated_data.get("pub_date", instance.pub_date)
        instance.save()
        return instance
    
    def get_is_recent(self, obj):
        return obj.pub_date >= timezone.now() - timezone.timedelta(days=7)
```
Here, you see the manual work that ModelSerializer normally handles automatically. This example also gives you model fields plus extra custom behavior, without touching the database model itself.

Use `BaseSerializer` for complete control
If you want to support alternative serialization and deserialization styles then you can inherit the `BaseSerializer` class and override these four functions depending on what functionality you want the serializer class to support:
  - `.to_representation()` - Override this to support serialization, for read operations
  - `.to_internal_value()` - Override this to support deserialization, for write operations
  - `.create()` and `.update()` - Override either or both of these to support saving instances.
```python
from rest_framework.serializers import BaseSerializer
from .models import MultipleChoiceQuestion

class QuestionTextSerializer(BaseSerializer):
    def to_representation(self, obj: MultipleChoiceQuestion):
        return {"question_text": obj.question_text.upper()}

    def to_internal_value(self, data):
        return {"question_text": data["text"]}

    def create(self, validated_data):
        return MultipleChoiceQuestion.objects.create(**validated_data)

    def update(self, instance, validated_data):
        instance.question_text = validated_data.get("question_text", instance.question_text)
        instance.save()
        return instance
```
Here:
  - `.to_representation()` → controls how the model is turned into JSON. We only output `question_text`
  - `.to_internal_value()` → controls how incoming JSON is turned into Python data.
  - `.create()` and `.update()` → we still need to define these, just like with a normal `Serializer`
    - create() makes a new MultipleChoiceQuestion.
    - update() edits an existing one.

### Optional/Outside of Lab

It is in your best interest to Work through the rest of Django's First Steps Tutorials:

* [Part 5: Testing](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial05/)
* [Part 6: Static Files](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial06/)
* [Part 7: Customizing the Admin Site](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial07/)

## Phase Two: Heroku

**For phase two of the lab,** we will walk you through the deployment of your Django application onto Heroku.

### Setting up the Heroku CLI

Sign up for a Heroku account at [https://signup.heroku.com/](https://signup.heroku.com/). Be sure to **enable multi-factor authentication** (two-factor authentication) or Heroku will not allow you to sign in. 

You can apply for free Heroku credits for 12 months at [https://www.heroku.com/github-students](https://www.heroku.com/github-students) with an eligible GitHub student account [https://education.github.com/pack](https://education.github.com/pack). **We cannot guarantee that you will get free Heroku credits. As stated in the Course Outline, you may have to pay a small amount for Heroku.**

Note: Remember to clean up all Heroku resources after this course to avoid unexpected charges after exceeding the credit limit or the offer expires.

Download and install the [Heroku CLI tools](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install).

* Use the default installation instructions if you are on a VM or your own device.
* If using a lab machine, download and extract the tarball and add the binary to your path.

```bash
wget https://cli-assets.heroku.com/channels/stable/heroku-linux-x64.tar.gz
tar -xvf heroku-linux-x64.tar.gz
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/heroku/bin"
```

**NOTE:** If you are using a lab machine, the state of environment variables like `PATH` is tied to your current session. When you reconnect to the lab machine in the future, you will have to re-run `export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/heroku/bin"` to have `heroku` commands work. 

To avoid re-running this command every time you can append `export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/heroku/bin"` on a new line at the end of your `.bashrc` file. The `.bashrc` file is located by default in your home directory at: `~/.bashrc`. If you don't have a `.bashrc` file you can create one using `touch .bashrc`. 

The bash scripts in the `.bashrc` file are executed automatically when you create a new session with the lab machine, thus, you would no longer have to do that yourself.

Ensure the `heroku` tool works, login to your account.

```bash
heroku --version
# heroku/8.7.1 linux-x64 node-v16.19.0
heroku login
```

**NOTE:** If you are running on a lab machine you are going to need to access the virtual desktop of the lab machine to successfully complete `heroku login`. Follow these [instructions](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/computing-science/resources/technical-support/computing-resources/x2go-quick-guide.html) and run the commands through a terminal through the virtual desktop. This will allow you to open a browser *on the lab machine* and complete the authentication process.

### Preparing our Django Application for Heroku

Ensure the Django application created in Phase One is working locally.

Activate the virtualenv for the Django application.

Pip install [gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/), [whitenoise](https://github.com/evansd/whitenoise), [dj-database-url](https://github.com/jazzband/dj-database-url/), and [psycopg2-binary](https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2).

```bash
pip install gunicorn whitenoise dj-database-url psycopg2-binary
# gunicorn is a production level HTTP Server library
# whitenoise is a static file hosting middleware library
# dj-database-url is a library used to format the database url provided by HEROKU to be formatted for Django
# psycopg2-binary is a database adapter library
```

Save the new python requirements into the *requirements.txt* file.

```bash
pip freeze >| requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt` must be in the root of your repo for Heroku to detect your project as a Python/Django project!

<aside markdown="block" class="option1">
Create a new file named *Procfile* for Heroku applications. The file shall have following contents:

```text
web: gunicorn lab3.wsgi
```
</aside>

<aside markdown="block" class="option2">
If your Django PROJECT (not app) is in a subfolder like `lab3`, then you will need to write something like:

```text

Within *settings.py*, add/edit the following statements:

```python
# Update this variable
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["*"]

# Add at the bottom of the file
STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / "staticfiles" 
STATIC_URL = "/static/"
```

and then edit the `MIDDLEWARE` list to have `whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware` right after `django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware`:

```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    # ...
    "django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware",
    "whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware",
    # ...
]
```

### Deploying our Django Application to Heroku

First, [create an app](https://dashboard.heroku.com/new-app) on your Heroku dashboard. Keep in mind that a Heroku app is different from a Django app.

Commit your files and deploy the application using a the heroku command line tool. See [their article on how to do this](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git). Follow the instructions for an existing app, not a new app. Use `heroku git:remote`, **NOT** `heroku create`.
If you used `heroku create`, please see [this stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50421071/git-i-made-a-repository-inside-a-repository-and-now-i-just-want-the-one-big-rep) about how to return to a single repository.

You should have a heroku app. You should see it if you run the `heroku list` command. **In the following, `APPNAME` refers to this heroku app's name.**

### Using a Postgres Database on Heroku

Heroku provides additional services in addition to project hosting. In this case, we will need to add a postgresql database to our app.

```bash
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:essential-0 --app APPNAME
```

You can manage your essentials-0 postgres on your heroku dashboard under the resources section > add-ons.
<br><img id="access-panel" alt="access panel" src="{attach}postgres-add-on.png" style="width: 100%;">

Check that heroku is configuring the database: (You may need to wait a bit for the add-on to be installed)

```bash
heroku run "env" --app APPNAME
```

You should get an output like that contains a line that starts with `DATABASE_URL=postgres://` followed by a username and a password.

We now need to update our code to support saving data on Heroku using this environment variable. Edit `settings.py`:

```python
# at the very top of the file
import os
import dj_database_url

# ...

# Replace the old DATABASES variable declaration with this if statement

if os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL") != None:
    # Running on Heroku
    DATABASES = {
        "default": dj_database_url.config(
            conn_max_age=600,
            conn_health_checks=True,
            ssl_require=True
        )
    }
else:
    # Running locally.
    DATABASES = {
        "default": {
            "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
            "NAME": BASE_DIR / "db.sqlite3",
        }
    }
```

Commit your files and deploy the application again using the heroku command line tool.

Once it is deployed, check that django is now using your heroku postgres database:

<aside markdown="block" class="option1">
```bash
# If your django project is your git repo root
heroku run "python3 manage.py diffsettings" --app APPNAME
```
</aside>
<aside markdown="block" class="option2">
```bash
# If your django project is in a folder
heroku run "python3 lab3/manage.py diffsettings" --app APPNAME
```
</aside>


The output should contain a line like this that says `'default'` and has `'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql'`.

```
DATABASES = {'default': {'NAME': 'random letters', 'USER': 'random letters', 'PASSWORD': 'big hex number', 'HOST': 'something.amazonaws.com', 'PORT': 5432, 'CONN_MAX_AGE': 600, 'CONN_HEALTH_CHECKS': False, 'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql', 'OPTIONS': {'sslmode': 'require'}, 'ATOMIC_REQUESTS': False, 'AUTOCOMMIT': True, 'TIME_ZONE': None, 'TEST': {'CHARSET': None, 'COLLATION': None, 'MIGRATE': True, 'MIRROR': None, 'NAME': None}}}
```

If it contains `sqlite3`, something is wrong. Please check that you followed the steps correctly.

Run your migrations, create a Superuser, and ensure your application functionality works.

<aside markdown="block" class="option1">

```bash
heroku run "python manage.py migrate" --app APPNAME
heroku run "python manage.py createsuperuser" --app APPNAME
```

</aside>

<aside markdown="block" class="option2">
If your Django project is in a folder in your repo like `lab3`, you will need something like:

```bash
heroku run "python lab3/manage.py migrate" --app APPNAME
heroku run "python lab3/manage.py createsuperuser" --app APPNAME
```
</aside>

After this if you select your postgres database in the [Heroku dataclips interface](https://data.heroku.com/dataclips/create), you should see your polls_question and poll_choice tables.

Go to `/polls` on your Heroku deployed site, you should be able to use the Polls app from Heroku. 

Note: Please make sure that the Heroku app uses Postgres as the backend database. If you created the Heroku app through Git integration, this should be a default setting.

You can verify the backend in use by login into the dashboard of the Heroku app: [https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/APP_NAME](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/APP_NAME), then click the `Resources` tab, you should see `Heroku Postgres` under the `Add-ons` Section.

If you try to create the Heroku app through the Heroku webpage, you can follow the below instructions to enable Postgres.
[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deploying-django-app-on-heroku-with-postgres-as-backend/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deploying-django-app-on-heroku-with-postgres-as-backend/)

### Checking your Heroku app

You can use the `heroku open --app APPNAME` command to open your Heroku app in a web browser. 

* <div class="warning">You **must** do this to help us mark your work:</div> Add your apps hostname, cname, and ip address to the README.md file in your git repo. 
    * First get your heroku apps hostname, it will look something like `example-app-1234567890ab.herokuapp.com`.
    * Then get an IP address for it using the `nslookup` command and a public dns server not controlled by the University.
        * This will look something like `nslookup example-app-1234567890ab.herokuapp.com 1.1.1.1`.
            * The second argument is the DNS server's IP address. You could also use:
                * `nslookup example-app-1234567890ab.herokuapp.com 8.8.8.8`
                * `nslookup example-app-1234567890ab.herokuapp.com 9.9.9.9`
                    * Or any other [public DNS server](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=public+dns+servers&ia=answer&iax=answer). `1.1.1.1` `8.8.8.8` and `9.9.9.9` are just easy to remember!
    * Read the output of nslookup, it will say something like:
        * `example-app-1234567890ab.herokuapp.com  canonical name = ie02.ingress.herokuapp.com.`
        * `ie02.ingress.herokuapp.com`
        * `Address: 46.137.15.86`
    * Sometimes it doesn't have CNAME, this is fine:
        * `Name:   lab3test-fbb81150e720.herokuapp.com`
        * `Address: 34.201.81.34`
        * In this case, write "none" for the cname.
    * Write your app's hostname, cname, and ip address to the README.md in your git repo.
    * If it reports multiple addresses, you can list them all.
* Make sure you can use the admin panel on Heroku from your web browser.
    * Hint: shut down your localhost server if it's running to make sure you're not connecting to the one on your computer by accident!
    * Use the admin panel to add a poll.
* Make sure you can use the polls app on Heroku from your web browser.
* Make sure your Heroku app remembers the results of your polls and your superuser login!
    * If your Heroku is not configured properly to use PostgreSQL it will forget them randomly! (somewhere between 0 and 24 hours.)

* In the example above, I can list all 4 addresses: `54.224.34.30`, `54.224.34.30`, `34.201.81.34`, and `54.208.186.182` in my `README.md`.

Then, if I'm on the UWS firewall, I could also add all four addresses to my `hosts` file, to defeat the annoying UWS firewall:

```hosts
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       Roxanne.        Roxanne

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters

# All the stuff above was already in my hosts file ^^^^
# Don't remove the stuff that was already there!
# ----------------
# I added the stuff below vvvv

## Phase Three: More Features

Congratulations on getting your app deployed to Heroku! Let's add some new features to your application for you to deploy as well!

### TASK - Question Creation Route

At this point in the lab, we should have a working poll application deployed on Heroku. However, we need a way to programmatically create questions without using the admin panel! 

**Your task** is to add a new API route at `polls/api/question/add/` that will add a new multiple choice question when a POST request is received! It should return a 405 when any other method is received. The post payload will contain a JSON object with the properties `question_text` and `choice_options`. 

`question_text` is a string that MUST be AT LEAST 1 character long and AT MOST 200 characters long. `choice_options` is an array of choice objects that MUST have at least 1 choice. Each choice object must have a `choice_text` field that MUST be AT LEAST 1 character long and AT MOST 200 characters long. 

For example...

```json
{
    "question_text": "Should pineapple be on pizza?",
    "choice_options": [
        {"choice_text": "yes"},
        {"choice_text": "no"}
    ]
}
```

This should create 1 `MultipleChoiceQuestion` and 2 `MultipleChoiceOption`s. 

If a question or answer is not valid, (or if `question_text` or `choice_options` is not provided) it should not create any `MultipleChoiceQuestion` or `MultipleChoiceOption` and return an appropriately erroring http status response.

You can return any response so long as the HTTP status code returned is 201.

An example CURL request you can use to test your API is:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/polls/api/question/add/ \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"question_text":"Should pineapple be on pizza?", "choice_options":[{"choice_text":"yes"}, {"choice_text":"no"}]}'
```

**Task Requirements**

- MUST have a route available at `polls/api/question/add/` (e.g. localhost:8000/polls/api/question/add/)
    - MUST only handle POST and return a 405 when any other method is received.
- MUST verify the payload is correct
    - MUST check that `question_text` and `choice_options` were provided
    - MUST check that `question_text` is between 1-200 characters long
    - MUST check that each choice's `choice_text` is between 1-200 characters long
    - MUST check that there is AT LEAST one choice in `choice_options`
    - MUST not create any models if any validation step fails
    - MUST return an appropriately erroring http status code if validation fails
- MUST create a `MultipleChoiceQuestion` and multiple `MultipleChoiceOption` when the payload is valid
    - MUST respond with a status code of 201 after it was created

**Hint**: You'll need to use nested serializers for this task! You can create a `ChoiceOptionSerializer` for the choice objects and a `QuestionWithChoicesSerializer` that includes the nested choices. The validation will be handled automatically by the serializers based on your model field constraints! ([Documentation](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/))

### TASK - Comment Section

It feels a bit empty if we just have a poll page. So let's go ahead and add a comment section to each poll!

Add a new route in `polls/urls.py` to handle the form submission when a user submits the comment form to add a new comment.

```py
path('<int:question_id>/add_comment/', views.add_comment, name="add_comment")
```

Update `polls/views.py` to have a new `add_comment` function that will handle the processing of the comment form.

```py
def add_comment(request, question_id):
    # TODO: Your implementation here!
    pass
```

Next we need to update our `results.html` template to support rendering/adding comments. Replace the contents of `polls/results.html` file with be the following:

```html
<h1>{{ question.question_text }}</h1>

<ul>
{% for choice in question.multiplechoiceoption_set.all %}
    <li>{{ choice.choice_text }} -- {{ choice.votes }} vote{{ choice.votes|pluralize }}</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<a href="{% url 'polls:detail' question.id %}">Vote again?</a>

<div style="border: 1px solid #000; margin: 20px 0 0 0; padding: 0 0 10px 10px;">
    <h3>Add Comment</h3>
    <form method="POST" action="{% url 'polls:add_comment' question.id %}">
        <label style="font-weight: bold;">Username</label><br>
        <input name="username" type="text" maxlength="32" />
        <br /><br />
        <label style="font-weight: bold;">Message</label><br>
        <textarea name="content" style="min-width: 400px; max-width: 400px;"></textarea><br><br>
        <input type="submit" />
        {% csrf_token %}
    </form>
</div>

<h2>Comments</h2>
<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 10px;">
    {% for comment in question.comment_set.all %}
        <div style="border: 1px solid #000; padding: 0 0 20px 10px;">
            <h3>{{ comment.username }} - {{ comment.created_at|date:'Y/m/d H:i' }}</h3>
            <hr />
            <div class="content">{{ comment.content }}</div>
        </div>
    {% endfor %}
</div>
```

**Your task** is to create a new `Comment` model with a `username` char field, a `created_at` date time field, and a `content` text field. It should also have a foreign key reference field to a `MultipleChoiceQuestion` that can be named anything you'd like. **It is important that you do not change the model name or field names/types or else the template will likely not render your comments.** The max length of the `username` field will be 32 characters.

**Secondly,** you must handle the backend for validating and creating a new comment object when a `POST` request is sent and received at your `add_comment` endpoint that we created earlier in this task section. The post payload will contain a `username` and `content` that correspond to the two fields you see when you goto the results page of a poll. After creating the comment, the client should be redirected back to the poll result page so that they can see their new comment. **If either property is blank or invalid,** you should not create a new instance of the `Comment` model and instead just redirect back to the poll result page.

**Task Requirements**

- MUST create a `Comment` model with a...
    - `username` char field
    - `created_at` date time field
    - `content` text field
    - foreign key reference to the `MultipleChoiceQuestion` the comment belongs to
- MUST have a route available at `polls/<question_id>/add_comment/`
    - MUST create a new `Comment` if the `username` and `content` form fields passed to the request are valid
        - If the fields are not provided/empty, it must not create a new `Comment`
    - MUST ensure the username field is at most 32 characters
    - MUST redirect back to the poll result page after processing the request
- MUST have comments be shown on results page after adding a new comment
- MUST 404 if the question id provided is invalid

### TASK - Markdown Comments

At this point in the lab, you should have a working comment section. Let's add markdown rendering to your comments! Similarly to the last lab, we will need to transpile a javascript file! 

We will need to install `marked` and `esbuild` in our root repository directory again.

```bash
npm install --save-dev marked
npm install --save-dev esbuild
```

Create a new folder in the root repository directory called `webapp`, add a new file called `markdown-renderer.js`, and paste the following javascript code in it:
```js
import { marked } from "marked"; // Import the markdown converter

// Handle rendering
window.addEventListener('load', () => {
    const contentDivs = document.getElementsByClassName('content');
    for (const contentDiv of contentDivs) {
        const markdownText = contentDiv.innerHTML;
        const htmlOutput = marked(markdownText);
        contentDiv.innerHTML = htmlOutput;
    }
});
```

**Your task** is to run the transpilation command in the root repository directory so that we can make this JavaScript code ready for use in our browser!

```bash
# If you ran django-admin startproject lab3 .
npx esbuild ./webapp/markdown-renderer.js --bundle --minify --sourcemap --outfile=./polls/static/markdown-renderer.min.js

# If you ran django-admin startproject lab3
npx esbuild ./webapp/markdown-renderer.js --bundle --minify --sourcemap --outfile=./lab3/polls/static/markdown-renderer.min.js
```

Next, we need to include this javascript file into our HTML! Edit `templates/polls/results.html` and add at the top of the file

```
{% load static %}
```

and at the bottom of the file

```html
<script src="{% static 'markdown-renderer.min.js' %}"></script> <!-- Load bundled JS -->
```

Congratulations! Your comment section should now have markdown support! You can test this by typing in a comment to any poll with the content `**this text should be bold!**` to see if your markdown renderer is working!

After you receive your grade, you can delete your Heroku app to save credits/money.

# Collaboration

* You may consult with others (exchange high-level ideas) but the submission should be your own source code.
* Collaboration must be documented in your source code.
* Any source code you got from anywhere else must be cited in the source code. This includes code from LLMs.
* You can only use source code that **you understand**: see the [lab marking info]({filename}/general/labs.md#lab-marking)
* For more information see the collaboration section in the outline: [{filename}/general/outline.md#consultation-assignments-labs]

# Tips

Django is a complex framework and maybe overwhelming at times. You should consult the documentation should you run into any issues with the framework. 

If you're unable to load a static file or resource, it maybe because you're not referencing it correctly. It may be in a different directory or you have a typo when you are referencing that particular resource using its path. 

Another common problem is not being able to render the templates even though you're directory structure is correct. Make sure your app is registered in `settings.py` otherwise it may not render.

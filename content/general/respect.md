---

Respect is a requirement in this course. Please remember that TAs are here to help you learn, but they are students too with their own courses and homework. Everyone is expected to remain respectful and collegiate when interacting with the TAs. In turn, the TAs are also expected to remain respectful and collegiate when interacting with you. We are all here to learn and teach, but that's only possible if we all work together toward that end. Please help everyone by treating TAs as your allies rather than your adversaries.

Do not:

Attempt to keep the TAs past the end of your walkthrough time slot that you signed up for,
interrupt the TAs while the TAs is trying to take another student's walkthrough,
interrupt the TAs while the TAs is between taking walkthroughs,
attempt to take TA time from other students,
be rude to the TAs,
be hostile to the TAs,
attempt to bully the TAs,
attempt to make the TAs keep talking to you when they have moved on or do not wish to talk with you anymore,
or make demands of the TAs.

Any aggression or hostility towards the TAs, or harassment or bullying of the TAs will not be tolerated and will be reported to the University SSE team for investigation under the Student Conduct Policy (SCP).

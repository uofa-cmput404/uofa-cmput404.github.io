# Lab Procedure

* [H01 Monday Signup Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TgVe_SXOEQHiH2ZrGsdccL6wndSUhZhIVqDX4HA7wvk/edit)
* [H02 Wednesday Signup Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EBqOV0GJHfQvzm4jrQYani2ghWrfVuQMHtoesph4kMc/edit)

* You **must walk through your individual lab work to a TA** during the lab to receive marks.
    * If you submit on eClass but don't walk through your code with a TA you will get a zero.
    * You MUST walk through your lab in person.
    * Walkthroughs are during the second half of your registered lab section on BearTracks (6:00 PM-7:50)
* Labs are due on eClass and GitHub at 4PM on Monday.
    * If you walk through your code with a TA but don't submit you will get a zero.
    * If you don't submit a link to your GitHub on eClass you will get a zero.
    * If you submit but don't walk through your code with a TA you will get a zero.

The TAs will do their best to keep strictly to the schedule on the walkthrough signup sheet.

# Lab Marking

## Rubric

Your grade on the lab is the percentage of your code that you **completed and** can demonstrate to the TA during your walkthrough that you **understand.** You must be able to explain your code to the TA and explain why you chose to write your code the way you did.

For example, you might be asked to explain:

* Why you chose a certain structure?
* Why you needed a particular variable?
* The role a method serves in letting two classes communicate.
* The difficulties you had when developing your code.

Note that simply reading the code to the TA does **not** count as understanding.

## Examples

1. Example:
    * Your code works perfectly. 
    * You can explain your code to the TA during the demo.
    * Grade: 100
2. Example:
    * Your code works perfectly.
    * You can explain most of your code to the TA during the walkthrough, but you can't explain why you chose to use a `while` loop instead of a `for` loop for a critical component.
    * Grade: 90
3. Example:
    * Your code works perfectly.
    * You can explain some of your code to the TA during the walkthrough.
    * But, it seems like you don't understand half of the code for one of two problems in the lab.
    * Grade: 75
4. Example:
    * Your code is halfway complete.
    * You can explain your code perfectly.
    * Grade: 50
4. Example:
    * Your code works perfectly.
    * You can only explain half of your code.
    * Grade: 50
5. Example:
    * Your code is halfway complete.
    * You can only explain half of your code.
    * Grade: 25
6. Example:
    * Your code works perfectly.
    * You can't explain any of your code, and it doesn't seem like you understand it at all.
    * Grade: 0
7. Example:
    * Your code mostly works. The TA estimates it is 80% done.
    * You can't explain any of your code, and it doesn't seem like you understand it at all.
    * Grade: 0
8. Example:
    * Your code doesn't work at all.
    * Grade: 0
9. Example:
    * Your code looks like it isn't even for the current lab
    * Grade: 0
10. Example:
    * Your code works perfectly
    * You can explain your code to the TA with no problem
    * But, you forgot to submit it on eClass
    * Grade: no grade (but this counts the same as a 0)
11. Example:
    * Your code works perfectly
    * You can explain your code to the TA with no problem
    * But, you plagiarized, misrepresented your work, or other academic misconduct (cheating)
    * Grade: 100, and you get interviewed by the instructor, and you get interviewed by the Dean's office, and you probably get sanctioned by the Dean's office, and you probably receive letter of reprimand, and the Dean's officer can set your grade to 0 anyway. Or the Dean's officer might fail you for the entire course, or whatever they decide, they have their own rules.

# Development Environment

# GitHub Classroom

If you do not submit to eClass on time:

* We have no way of knowing which GitHub repo is yours.
* We have no way of knowing if you intend to submit the lab/project.
* We have no way of tracking which lab/project have been graded and which assignments still need to be graded.
* We have no way of knowing if we missed someone's lab/project.

Also:

* We have no way of tracking things like excused absences (weight transfer if someone is sick) on GitHub. (Even if we did it would violate University policy for us to do so.)
* We have no way of tracking accessibility accommodations on GitHub. (Even if we did it would violate University policy for us to do so.)
* We have no way of tracking grades on GitHub. (Even if we did it would violate University policy for us to do so.
* The GitHub due date thing does not always work correctly.
* By University policy, GitHub (like Mentimeter) is not an approved platform. eClass/Canvas/Google Apps are the only approved platforms. So, instructors and TAs are not allowed to tell GitHub who you are, we have to allow you to be pseudonymous. For example, we are not allowed to tell GitHub/Mentimeter your name, your student ID#, your CCID, etc. This is also why Menti uses codenames.
* Because of this policy we also cannot give grades or feedback on GitHub.

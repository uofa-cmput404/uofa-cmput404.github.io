          <li>If I go to bank.com how do I know that I'm really
            talking to bank.com?
          </li>
          <li>Without TLS, I don't: my connection can be intercepted
            by IP, TCP, and DNS attacks...
          </li>
          <li>Without TLS it's relatively easy to intercept connections
            meant for a webserver and serve them yourself.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section style="font-size: 80%">
        <ul>
          <li>Example: Evil WiFi cafe! I could set up an evil WiFi cafe,
            where people come, sit down, connect to my "secure" WiFi.
            Then when someone tries to make a connection to someplace
            interesting like their bank, my WiFi router can redirect 
            their packets to my own web server! I could make it look
            just like their bank's website, allowing them to enter
            their username and password.
          </li>
          <li>Evil WiFi cafe could also simply intercept DNS requests
            and respond with the address of a fake bank webserver instead.
          </li>
          <li>This is not limited to WiFi: anyone with access to a network
            where TCP/IP and DNS traffic is going accross, such as one of
            the many networks that make up the internet, can do the same
            or similar attacks.
          </li>
          <li>It's not limited to routers either: just sitting next to
            someone at a wifi cafe would allow you to perform similar
            attacks
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>TLS: Identity</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>With TLS I can ensure the server I'm connected to is the
            server I meant to connect to.
          </li>
          <li>This is done with <em>certificates</em>.</li>
          <li>A certificate works like an ID card.</li>
          <li>The server sends a certificate with its domain name
            (called a "Common Name") and a big number called a public key.
          </li>
          <li>The certificate also includes other details, such as 
            who made it, for example, "Bank Inc."</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>Okay so the server hands me their certificate, it has
            a big number and it says it's the bank, but how do I know
            a fake websitie didn't just make a big number and claim to
            be the bank?
          </li>
          <li>The certificate also has one crucial thing:
            a <em>cryptographic signature</em>.
          </li>
          <li>The signature is produced by someone else, and only 
            matches one public key and domain name.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Signed Certificates</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The certificate's signature is unique to that certificate.</li>
          <li>If you change the public key or the domain name, the
            signature won't match anymore.</li>
          <li>The certificate's signature also comes from a specific
            entity that made that signature.</li>
          <li>It tells us who signed it, and only they could have
            produced that signature.</li>
          <li>No one else can pretend to have signed the certificate,
            or the signature won't match.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section style="font-size: 85%">
        <h3>Cryptographic Signatures</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I make a private key and a public key as a part of a
            cryptographic signature algorithm.
          </li>
          <li>I keep my private key secret, known only to me.</li>
          <li>I give away my public key to the whole world so everyone
            knows it's my public key.</li>
          <li>I make signatures by combining my private key and some other
            information I want to sign. In this case its the banks domain name and the bank's different public key.
          </li>
          <li>You can check my signature by using my public key (which I already gave you) and combining it with the signature and information that's been signed to check it.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Certificate Authority (CA)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A certificate authority uses their private key to
            sign the bank's certificate.</li>
          <li>The bank sends their certificate to you so you can check
            it.</li>
          <li>You have the CA's public key.</li>
          <li>You combine it with the banks certificate.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>Now you know:
            <ul>
              <li>The bank's domain name</li>
              <li>The bank's public key</li>
              <li>That the CA says those are really the bank's
                <ul>
                  <li>But how does the CA know?</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The bank sends their certificate when you connect.</li>
          <li>The CA's public key is already on your computer. It came
            with your OS or your browser when you downloaded it.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section style="font-size: 80%">
        <h3>Identity Problems</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You don't have the CA's public key
            <ul>
              <li>There's no way to know if the bank's domain name and public key are correct :(

              <li>Removing bad or leaked CAs</li>

              <li>Checking lists of known certificates to make
                sure someone didn't get a second certificate to
                pretend to be the bank (Certificate Transparency)</li>
              <li>Checking lists of known bad certificates and
                certificates that have been "revoked" (CRLs)</li>

          <li>TLS <em>everything</em>
            <ul>
              <li>Make sure all traffic to/from your web app is running over TLS</li>
              <li>Example: it may not help if only login is over TLS 
                because an attacker can replace your TLS-encrypted login page with an unencrypted one by replacing the link on the unencrypted main site</li>

        <h3>Avoiding TLS Security Problems</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep software up to date
            <ul>
              <li>No Windows XP</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Don't communicate with out-of-date software</li>
          <li>Example: if something on your site is meant to be secret,
            even one bad client can leak the secret!</li>
